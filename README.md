# Plot Complex Functions
Dynamicly plot various functions on complex domain.

Plot complex function  
  **z2 = f(z1)**  
where the value of z1 is provided by the position of the mouse  
  (with fine adjustments performed with keyboard arrows)  
    
Set the function to be plotted (and title) at @@@ eyecatcher

## cpxFunPlot
Plot the domain value *z* and its function value *f(z)* 
on the same complex plane. Out of bounds values will not be 
shown; scale may be adjusted at appropriate line of code.
